I've noticed that there aren't many websites with legitimate SQL practice questions. However, there are websites that demand a premium for this service. Fortunately, I discovered a free website that offered a ton of SQL questions, however those questions were difficult to understand because to the vocab used, and the most of the answers were wrong. As a result, I changed the questions' wording and provided my own, MySQL-based solutions in place of the original website's Postgre answers. This project now has more than 350 questions, ranging from simple to complex topics like Cartesian products, Joins, Subqueries, DDL, DML, DQL etc. Anyone who practices these questions will, in my opinion, be an expert in SQL. In the future, more practice questions will be added.
